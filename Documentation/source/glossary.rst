    Allocator
        An allocator is any user-specified structure used for memory allocation.
        This is intended for any custom memory management that's tied to a local
        structure. See the section on specific usage, :ref:`using-an-allocator`.

    C string
        C strings are the form of string that string literals in C and C++ use.
        They're an array of characters followed by a single null character.
